# Cloudflare MCP Server (WIP)

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Cloudflare services. It provides a unified interface for managing Cloudflare KV Store, Workers, and Analytics.

## Features

### Workers Management
- `worker_list`: List all Workers in your account
- `worker_get`: Get a Worker's script content
- `worker_put`: Create or update a Worker script
- `worker_delete`: Delete a Worker script

### Analytics
- `analytics_get`: Retrieve analytics data for your domain
  - Includes metrics like requests, bandwidth, threats, and page views
  - Supports date range filtering

## Setup

1. Run `npx @cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare init`
2. Restart Claude Desktop, you should see a small ðŸ”¨ icon that shows the following tools available for use:

### KV Store
```javascript
// Get value
kv_get({ key: "myKey" })

// Store value
kv_put({ key: "myKey", value: "myValue" })

```

### Workers
```javascript

})
```
